// Bring an agent's Orca tab to the foreground: `orca terminal switch <handle>`.
//
// Orca hands every terminal it opens an ORCA_TERMINAL_HANDLE, and the agent
// running inside inherits it, so the handle in /proc/<pid>/environ addresses
// the exact tab that agent is typing into. That is the whole mechanism; the
// CLI does the window management.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL: an Orca-hosted agent also inherits whatever terminal
// Orca itself was launched from. On this desk Orca was started from a Herdr
// pane, so all six Orca agents carried the SAME HERDR_PANE_ID (w30:p1) and the
// desk sent every one of their clicks to that one pane. The card looked broken
// while pointing at a real, live pane. Orca wins over inherited multiplexer
// variables in sessionHostsFromEnvironment for that reason.
